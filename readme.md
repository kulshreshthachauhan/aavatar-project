# Text-Conditioned Scene Generation with Stable Diffusion

This repository provides a solution to place an objectâ€™s image into a realistic scene, conditioned by a text prompt, using generative AI techniques. The project utilizes *Stable Diffusion Inpainting* models to generate images that blend the object with the scene naturally while ensuring coherence in the context defined by the text prompt.

## Problem Statement

Generative AI can significantly reduce the cost and effort required for creating realistic product images, traditionally shot in photography studios. The task here is to take an image of an object (e.g., a product) and generate a scene based on a user-defined text prompt, ensuring the object is realistically integrated into that scene. 

For example, placing a product with a white background into a kitchen scene using the prompt:


"Product in a kitchen used in meal preparation"


The final output should have the product naturally placed in the scene, with realism being maintained by adjusting factors like aspect ratio, spatial placement, and lighting.

## Approach

### Libraries Used
The project leverages the following tools and libraries:
- **diffusers**: Provides the inpainting models for generating images based on the Stable Diffusion framework.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Handles image file I/O.
- **torch**: Used for model execution, leveraging CUDA for faster computations where available.

### Model Used
The project utilizes the *Stable Diffusion Inpainting* model from Hugging Face's stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting for generating the image output.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

Install the required Python libraries by running:
bash
pip install torch torchvision diffusers Pillow


## How to Run

The code accepts an object image and a text prompt as input, generating a natural scene that matches the prompt.

### Command:
bash
python run.py --image ./path_to_input_image.jpg --text-prompt "Your descriptive text" --output ./output_image.png


### Example Command:
bash
python run.py --image ./example.jpg --text-prompt "product in a kitchen used in meal preparation" --output ./generated.png


### Arguments:
- --image: The file path of the input image of the object (e.g., ./example.jpg)
- --text-prompt: The descriptive text to generate the scene (e.g., "product in a kitchen used in meal preparation")
- --output: The file path to save the generated image (e.g., ./generated.png)

## Results

### Input Example:

| Input Image | Text Prompt |
|-------------|-------------|
| ![Input Image](./example.jpg) | "Product in a kitchen used in meal preparation" |

### Generated Output:

| Output Image |
|--------------|
| ![Generated Image](./generated.png) |

The resulting image shows the object naturally placed in a scene as per the given text prompt.

## Additional Task (Optional): Video Generation

As an additional creative challenge, you can extend the project to generate a video output by rendering multiple frames that show the object or camera moving in the scene (e.g., zooming out, panning). This can be done by generating multiple consistent images and combining them into a video.

### Video Generation Concept:
- *Zoom Out*: Gradually zoom the camera out of the scene.
- *Object Movement*: Move the object to different parts of the scene while maintaining realism.

## Deliverables

### What to Submit
- The GitHub repository containing:
  - The executable code (run.py)
  - Example input images
  - Generated results for sample text prompts
  - Failed and successful experiments (if applicable)
- A README file (this file), explaining how to run the code, approach, and any challenges.

### Example Input and Output:
You can find example images in the provided dataset, or create your own object images.

## Future Enhancements
Here are some possible future improvements:
- *Enhanced Scene Realism*: By experimenting with object placement and lighting alignment.
- *Video Output*: Generate a small video by rendering multiple frames for zoom or panning effects.
- *Model Fine-Tuning*: Fine-tune the model for specific product categories or e-commerce settings to improve the output quality.
